# ContEx Change Log

## In progress (commits to master)
- Fixed incorrect closed path in sparkline
- Allowed forcing of value range in `BarPlot` (`BarPlot.force_value_range\2`)
- Changed `BarPlot` colour handling to pass through to `ColourCategoryScale`
- Changed `new\3` to `new\1` on various plots as width & height are now set by `Plot`
- Prevented infinite loop in `ColourCategoryScale` when setting palette to `nil` (turns out `nil` is an atom)
- Fixed divide by zero error in `ContinuousScale` (needed to test for float as well as integer)
- Enabled legend for point plot
- Added multiple series for point plot (note - must share a common x value at this stage)
